        Crypto Cowboys are the first collection for those who got REKT in
        crypto. 11,111 Cowboys are randomly generated and stored as an ERC-721
        token on the Ethereum blockchain. All Ghosts will be minted on opensea
        for a fixed price of 0.04 ETH + gas.

        The crypto world isnâ€™t always a nice and safe place. Every day people
        are getting REKT by shitcoins, scams, hacks, rug pulls and leverage
        trading. These people then turn into various outlaws wandering the wild
        west that is the crypto world. And you may be one of them. The main
        utility idea of Crypto Cowboys is to help people especially new comers
        better understand the risk in the crypto world and stay safe.
