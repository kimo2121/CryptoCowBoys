        allow users to acquire, buy, sell, own and transfer, the unique digital
        characters known as Crypto cowboys (hereafter “Crypto cowboys”) located
        at www.cryptocowboys.org (the “Site”). Before using the Smart Contracts

          the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the website/application.{" "}
        </p>

          (b) Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with the

        <p>
          You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or
          attempt to do any of the foregoing without Creator’s express prior
          written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased
          NFT in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs,
          drawings, attributes, or color schemes (your use of Extensions will
          not constitute a prohibited modification hereunder); (ii) use the Art
          for your Purchased NFTs in connection with images, videos, or other
          forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or
          anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech
          or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (iii) use the Art for
          your Purchased NFTs in movies, videos, or any other forms of media,
          except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in
          Section 3(b) above or solely for your own personal, non-commercial
          use; (iv) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without
          limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or
          otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or
          consists of the Art for your Purchased NFTs, except as expressly
          permitted in Section 3(b) above; (v) attempt to trademark, copyright,
          or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to
          the Art for your Purchased NFTs; or (vi) otherwise utilize the Art for
          your Purchased NFTs for your or any third party’s commercial benefit.
          To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased NFTs contains
          Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity,
          athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows:
          (w) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any
          way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and
          restrictions contained herein; (x) that the Commercial Use license in
          Section 3(b) above will not apply; (y) that, depending on the nature
          of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, Creator
          may need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to
          use the Art; and (z) to the extent that Creator informs you of such
          additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be
          responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date
          that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed
          a breach of this license. The restriction in Section 4 will survive
          the expiration or termination of this License.

        <p>5. Terms of License.</p>
        <p>
          The license granted in Section 3 above applies only to the extent that

          sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your
          Purchased NFT for any reason, the license granted in Section 3 will
          immediately expire with respect to those NFTs without the requirement
          of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for
          those NFTs. If you exceed the $200,000 limitation on annual gross
          revenue set forth in Section 3.b above, you will be in breach of this
          License, and must send an email to Creator at ____________ within

          entering into a broader license agreement or obtaining an exemption
          (which may be granted or withheld in Creator’s sole and absolute
          discretion). If you exceed the scope of the license grant in Section

          Creator for any costs and expenses incurred by Creator during the
