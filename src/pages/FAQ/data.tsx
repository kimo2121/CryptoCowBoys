    paragraph:
      "Crypto Cowboys are the first collection for those who got REKT in crypto. 11,111 Cowboys are randomly generated and stored as an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are unique digital assets that users can buy, own, authenticate, and trade. Specific to each NFT is a digital certificate that validates it as a one-of-a-kind asset via its unique metadata. Any type of media can be turned into an NFT, and while some NFTs are purely digital art, others offer additional utility such as exclusive access to websites or events.",
